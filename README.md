## Assumptions
During the development of ToDo, I intentionally chose to use as few external libraries as possible.

I chose SCSS (Sass) over traditional CSS for TaskMaster's styling due to its numerous benefits:

1. Modularity: SCSS enables modular, reusable code through variables, mixins, and partials, making maintenance easier.
2. Nesting: SCSS's nesting feature simplifies CSS selectors, reducing code duplication and improving readability.
3. Variables: SCSS variables allow for consistent color schemes, typography, and spacing throughout the application.
4. Functions: SCSS functions enable complex calculations and transformations, streamlining styling tasks.
5. Compatibility: SCSS compiles to CSS, ensuring seamless browser compatibility.

Using SCSS enhanced my productivity, code organization, and overall styling efficiency, resulting in a more polished and maintainable UI.

I deliberately chose to forego modern technologies like Tailwind CSS, Shadcn components, and FramerMotion to showcase my foundational expertise in web development.
